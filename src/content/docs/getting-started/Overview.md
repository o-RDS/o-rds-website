# Open-Source Respondent Driven Sampling

o-RDS is a brand new tool focusing on streamlining web RDS surveys. It has been developed to be open-source, modular, and easy to use, ensuring researchers can quickly get their surveys up and running and developers working on the project can increase its capabilities if need be. The open source nature also allows the community to take part in building a unified web-based Respondent Driven Sampling application.

## Demoing o-RDS

o-RDS is stored on Github [here](https://github.com/o-RDS). The organization page contains two repositories, the client and the proxy server. The client is the frontend of the application and proxy server acts as the backend providing authentication and security for the client. o-RDS can be demoed at [o-RDS.com](https://o-rds.com/admin/register). To demo the product, register for an account and then log in; from there, you can explore the software as much as you need.
