# Open-Source Respondent Driven Sampling

o-RDS is a brand new tool focusing on streamlining web RDS surveys. It has been developed to be open-source, modular, and easy to use, ensuring researchers can quickly get their surveys up and running and developers working on the project can increase its capabilities if need be. The open source nature also allows the community to take part in building a unified web-based Respondent Driven Sampling application.
