# Survey Data  

This folder is used as temporary storage for verifying survey takers. 

Once a survey taker is sent a code, their information is stored here until they verify their phone number. Once they've verified, their data is deleted. 

A current feature that needs to be implemented is a periodic cleaning of this folder's data from anyone who initiated the phone verification, but did not complete it.
